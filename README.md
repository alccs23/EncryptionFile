# EncryptionFile
This is a personal project of mine. I'm doing this as a series of short-ish personal projects in order to learn more about C. I'm doing this one in particular because cryptograhpy has been something that has always interested me, but I have never had the time to really learn in depth. So this code I'm developing is killing two birds with one stone. This project will be a program that will be runnable and will encrypt any .txt file using AES-128 encryption. The backend (the encryption stuff) will be done in C, while the frontend will be done in another language that is more suited for making Guis (IDK at the moment).
